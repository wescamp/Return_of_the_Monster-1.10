        story= _ "It was spring in the North, so the stream was fast, and the water was clean and cold. It emptied into the Bark River, which carried much water from the mountains to the ocean. For part of its journey, the river flowed to the east, through the northern lands of an Elvish domain known as the Silent Forest. In this third century of Wesnoth, nagas sometimes scouted the Elvish lands, and were familiar with them. Mountains lay north of the naga territory, and these mountains were home to loosely-allied bands of orcs. The orcs already had enough land, but being orcs, they often invaded areas where nagas and other creatures lived."

        story= _ "Sometimes, the orc invasions were repulsed, but often the orcs were too numerous and too strong, and they would capture the area temporarily. On those occasions, the nagas had to temporarily flee for their lives. There were brave fighters, and many stirring stories, on both sides of the conflict. After years of this back and forth, a large dragon-like reptile appeared in the region. He was wise and proved to be an inspired leader. He convinced local lizards to be allies with the nagas. He surprised everyone by calling forth a race of turtle-like and crab-like creatures, called carapace-guards, that lived along the sea shore. Even more amazing, he brought in a race of fire fairies that lived near the volcanoes in the mountains. As a result, there arose a legend: - <i>when darkness takes hold of the world, flame arises to end the reign of darkness</i>. Some of the races believed that this spoke of an actual event far in the past, not just a myth. Whether true or not, the appearance of the dragon-like reptile, having fire breath, gave them reason to unite against the marauding orcs."

         story= _ "When the orcs next came, they were strong and well led, but the allied races eventually won. The orcs had not expected fire-breathing fairies and fighters that were covered by hard shells. Nagas and saurians alike celebrated the hard-won victory and were happy to follow their new leader.
Orcs, however, were not so happy. They immediately began discussing a plan to strike again against the allied races. As soon as scouts saw the main force of carapace-guards depart to go home to the sea, the orcish lord sent messengers to the city of Farzi to summon the greatest orcish wizard of all, known as Zooke."

        story= _ "In naga society, spawning season was coming for their Queen, Hassalia. Though brave fighters, nagas were not physically tough, and they had many enemies. Hence, their society spread in small groups or family bands, so that the destruction of one or two groups would not doom their entire race. Most young nobles would leave home to find, or establish, a group of their own to lead. One particular young noble, Amailoss, born from the Queen's last egg some years ago, was preparing to leave the home nest. It was unusual that his departure would happen during spawning season, but this was a time of truce with the orcs..."
