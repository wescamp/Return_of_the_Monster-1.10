"It was time for Amailoss, born from the naga queen's last egg, to leave "
"home. Time for him to grow into a leader in his own right, and eventually "
"become the guardian and leader of some other naga city. But along the way, "
"he became friends with an unusual mud-crawler, they met a strange young "
"monster, discovered that a spirit had escaped from an orc prison, and the "
"mystery of that spirit became a grave challenge for Amailoss and the many "
"races in the region....\n"
"\n"
"A naga campaign, involving elves, orcs, saurians, turtle-like races, and "
"some monsters. There are 16 game-play and 2 dialog scenarios. All scenarios "
"are here and playable. This is still an early release, so bugs are possible, "
"and some scenarios may need more balancing. Feedback on all aspects of the "
"campaign will be gratefully received. \n"

"Snow fairies have haunted the highlands of Wesnoth for centuries, preferring "

"Snow fairies are powerful, ethereal, and elusive; even dwarvish wardens and "
"the highest-flying drakes rarely encounter them. They harness the elemental "
"power of the mountains to work their magic, suddenly animating the wiry "
"highland plants to entangle an unsuspecting target, or assailing their foes "
"with a magically-created cold flash of arctic purity."
